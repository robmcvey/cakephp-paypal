This component can handle two type of PayPal transaction, Express Checkout and Direct Payment.

## Express Checkout

https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_api_WPGettingStarted

First, set some basic information about the transaction you want to perform, amount, currency etc. and call `Paypal::expressCheckout()`. 

The user is redirected to PayPal where they log in, they are then redirected back to your site (to the return URL).

You can then use `Paypal::getExpressCheckoutDetails()` to fetch basic customer information, their billing address etc.

If they are happy and want to proceed with purchase, call `Paypal::doExpressCheckoutPayment()` which then completes the payment.

## Direct Payment

https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_api_WPDirectPayment

The customer enters their billing information on your website (SSL required) and you use this to call `Paypal::doDirectPayment()` which will attempt to bill their card.

### Notes

Do not store credit card numbers, CVV numbers etc. in your database, sessions, cookies.
